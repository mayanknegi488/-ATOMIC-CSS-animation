# -ATOMIC-CSS-animation
This is a simple "loading" animation made using HTML and CSS only.


Hello folks!
Here, I've tried to make a simple animation with the help of CSS. Its something sort of an atomic structure with the orbits floating around the nucleus. Simple but fun!
The two main properties of CSS i used here are 'animation', 'transform' and 'nth-child'.
